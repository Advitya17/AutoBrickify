# Configurations Instructions for point label format

Consider a point label metadata string example - 

`EBU3B.1ST-FLR.RM-1244.VAV-1N25.ZN-T`

Assuming '.' as a delimiter, the string above will be split into 5 parts. Hence, the user will be required to specify a list in the `point_label_format` of length 5 in the data-params.json file to sequentially specify how a column of each part should be treated/parsed.

Every single element of the list should be specified as per one of three possibilities:
1. `null` if the part is of no use.
2. string (among {UpstreamAHU, ZoneName, VAVName, BrickClass}) depending upon the semantic meaning of the part.
3. list of any of the column names (specified in (2)), if a column generated by a part needs to be replicated.
