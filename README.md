# Zonal Air Handling Replication Project

## Purpose of the offered implementation
Programming a HVAC system to measure and change airflow rates from maximum to minimum and monitor the CO2 Density and Relative Humidity in a classroom and a conference room inside the EBU3B (CSE) building at UC San Diego.

## Contents
The current contents of this repository include:
1. A rudimentary data ingestion pipeline
2. Documentation (as shown here)
3. The main runnable python script (`run.py`)
4. Params file (`data-params.json`)

## How to run it
TODO

`python run.py data`

### Questions to consider (TODO: remove later!)
1. Where/how to get the data? (I'll email prof)
2. What should the data ingestion pipeline look like? (Lectures/TAs/AF)
